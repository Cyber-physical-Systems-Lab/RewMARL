# RewMARL
This repo implements mutualistic reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance robot cooperation. Tested on CartPendulum, ShadowHand, and Mobile Manipulation, it improves stability, convergence, and coordination. Includes code, results, and documentation. Contributions welcome! ðŸš€

This repository contains code for Investigating Symbiosis in Robotic Ecosystems: A Case Study for Multi-Robot Reinforcement Learning Reward Shaping.

Code is being prepared and will be available soon...
